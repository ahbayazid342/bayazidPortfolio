      "I completed my B.Sc. (Hons.) in Computer Science and Engineering from Jahangirnagar University, Dhaka, in 2021, graduating with a CGPA of <strong>3.30 out of 4.0</strong>. During my undergraduate studies, I was awarded <strong>three scholarships</strong>—one for admission and four for academic excellence. I also completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering with a CGPA of <strong>3.6 out of 4.0</strong>. My academic journey began with a perfect GPA of <strong>5.0 out of 5.0</strong> in both my Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) and Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exams.",

      "As a Software Engineer at Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh, I work on an internal web-based project that manages networking data using <strong>Spring Boot, React, and MongoDB</strong>. This project includes seven modules designed to handle 3G, 4G, and 5G data. RabbitMQ facilitates inter-module communication, while WebSocket enables real-time analytics. Additionally, I am also working on a separate project involving a <strong>Knowledge Graph RAG interface</strong> to enhance the retrieval and generation of information for private data. I have also contributed to <strong>patent</strong> development for Samsung, aligning business objectives with innovative solutions.",

      "In my research, I focus on making large language models more efficient and practical by exploring innovative techniques like model <strong>quantization</strong> and <strong>LoRA</strong> (Low-Rank Adaptation) and Knowledge Graph <strong>RAG</strong>. My goal is to enhance how these models perform, making them more useful for both private and public data in real-world applications. I have been working with the <strong>LLaMA 2</strong> and <strong>LLaMA 3</strong> models to develop and test proof-of-concept solutions, pushing the boundaries of what these models can achieve. I’m also involved in developing patents related to <strong>camera photography (enhance photo quality)</strong> using <strong>generative AI</strong>. This work is about pushing the envelope in how we capture and create images with higher quality details, blending cutting-edge technology with creative solutions.",
